Presentations in English
First Opening

    politeness (thanks for the invitation)
    Humor breaking the ice
    looks briefly at his notes, help to get into the topic again
    questions at the end to not lose track
    mentions what is going to happen in the presentation, to give the audience
      a frame of reference
  Disadvantage
    mention length of the presentation may be a positive too
      people may get overwhelmed (I have to listen to this guy for how long?!)
    using too much media (slides, notes and transparency)
    could be boring
    nervosity?
    selfdeprecating humor is unprofessional
    questions at the end is a long time to save it up, maybe a break in the middle


Second Opening
  Advantages
    using media in a dynamic way
    rhethorical questions to break the ice and build rapport with the audience
    confidence!
    breaking down the problem
