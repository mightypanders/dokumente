## Research 
### Man in the middle Attacks
- attacker relays and/or alters communication between two parties
- they believe to be directly communicating
- active eavesdropping
    - M receives Message from BOB
    - M reads Message and/or alters it
    - M transmits Message to ALICE, pretending to be BOB
    - both parties see M as the respective other dialog partner
- easy to do in unencrypted WiFi networks, as all packets are sent in the clear
- mutual authentication makes it harder for the MitM
- if the establishing of a key based authentication happens unencrypted the attacker can insert their own key.  

`Alice -> Hi Bob, give me your Key -> M -> Bob`  

`Alice -> M -> Hi Bob, its Alice give me your key -> Bob`  

`Alice <- M <- Bobs key <- Bob`  

`Alice <- Ms Key <- M <- Bob`  

`Alice -> Meet me at A(Ms Key) -> M -> Bob`  

`Alice -> M -> Meet me at b(Bobs Key) -> Bob`  

- Defense
  - Authentication
    - not over insecure channels (see above)
    - public private key infrastructure is the best option right now
      - encrypt message with recipients public key
      - decrpyt message with recipients private key
    - exchange keys in person for best security
  - Tamper Detection
    - does a transaction take a lot longer than usual? -> it might be tampered with!
- notable instances of MitM Attacks
  - Belkin wireless routers hijacked unsecured HTTP connections and pretended to be the desired destination server. in this malicious response they presented ads for different belkin products.
### Cracking


### Vocabulary

 phishing - """Password harvesting""" nope neologismus basierend auf Phone Phreaking
