## Quick Presentations
### Data Trafficking
unauthorized transfer/publishing/reselling of data  
can be acquired via different means  

### Man in the Middle Attacks
catching data of two people who are communicating

### Identity Theft
impersonating people with stolen details like credit card numbers  
keylogging, phishing mails, financial gains  

### Cracking
crack open in a figurative manner  
famous through games, which can be run without having to pay for them  
how to crack? -> Reverse Engineering  
disassamble a program, find out how it works, bypass protection systems, reassemble, run  
**Birthday attacks** (high probability of same birthdays in a group)  
similar logic is used in cracking, e.g. serial keys

### Spamming
unsolicited electronic messages  
often used for phishing, bank details, identity theft  
blog spam, spam sites with links to other sites  

### Man in the Middle Attacks
A -> B -> C  
A <- B <- C  
B is MitM  

Countermeasures:
- Authentication
- Protocol hardening
- Timeout checking
- phorensic analysis
    - correctly signed certificates

### Ransomware 
Cryptoviral extortion  
Cryptovirology  
How to use cryptography to invade systems (?)  
enable access for other people (?)  
block access for the user, demands money to reinstate access  
cryptocurrency are often used to perform these transactions  
Trojans are often used to gain initial access to the system  

### Software cracking
modify software to remove limitations  
example: remove limitations of shareware (ad screens, limited number of starts)  
reverse engineer the software find an entrypoint  
convert binary file to assembler code


### Man in the Middle Attacks
Two Clients communicating  
they believe to be communicating directly  
MitM intercepts the message, manipulates it and passes it on
2013 Nokia Express Browser decrypted every HTTPS Package

### Keylogger  
Used to find out peoples passwords  
Sofwarebased
- Virus
- application captures keystrokes
- sends data via internet (if available)  

Hardwarebased
- pluggend into the computer that is to be attacked
- has to be retrieved at a later date  

Specialites
- ATM
- audiobased

### Identity Theft
steal identifying information can be used to commit financial fraud  
nearly completely unavoidable but the possibility can be lowered or the impact softened  
destroy documents and not just discard them when they contain sensitive information

### Keylogger
1. Software
- small piece of code
- logs the entered keys from the keyboard
- either stored or transmitted directly  

2. Hardware
- small piece of hardware
- inbetween keyboard and pc
- either transfers the files directly or has to be collected manually
- can be avoided by splitting up the input of the password to make it log incorrect information
