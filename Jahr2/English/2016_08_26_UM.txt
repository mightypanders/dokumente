The Operating System

The difference between applications software and operating systems:
    An operating systems directly communicates with the hardware, while an
    application software uses this direct communication. It sits on top of the
    operating system and does not have to worry about manipulating the hardware
    itself.

  Supervisor Program
    The supervisor program manages the operation and execution of all other
    programs and loads them from disk into memory when they are requested.

  Resident and non resident programs
    Resident programs stay in the working memory of the system while non-resident
    software only gets loaded on demand and frees it's space when it is not needed
    anymore. They are provided by the operating system as they are needed for the
    operation of the system.

  main functions of an operating system
    The most important, and mostly invisible, task of an operating system is the
    management of the hardware of the machine. The interaction between all these
    components is managed by the OS.
    The most visible aspect is the user interface that allows a normal person
    to interact with the machine and change it's state.
    This is facilitated by the third function of the operating system: it
    executes services and application software and provides them access to each
    other.
