Dear Sir or Madame,

I recently spoke with Mr. Jobbs on the phone. We have decided that we want to do business with you
and thus would like to place an order.  
We would like to refer to the offer extended to us concerning
two (2) AccuNAS An208L NAS rackmount devices, fitted with 8 1TB harddrives, 1 4GB memory option and
1 10Gbit Ethernet Card each. As agreed upon with Mr. Jobbs we would like to order these devices
under following conditions:
a rebate of 25% on current listing price and shipping will be handled by DDP Bochum, one week after
payment.  

As a loyal return customer we would like to forgo advance payments and instead would like to offer
payment in return for documents.
Furthermore we would like to ask for a free extension of the warranty to 5 years covering all parts
not just wear and tear.

Should there be any questions or problems please contact us immediately via Email or telephone.

We are looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards
