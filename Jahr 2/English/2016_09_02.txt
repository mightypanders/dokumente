definition of system utilities:
  A system utility is a small piece of software that comes shipped with an
  operating system and is intended to be used for very specific tasks. As such
  their capabilities are limited in scope, but execute those very well. They
  help manage and tune aspects of the operating system.

main purpose of system utilities:
  System utilities help manage and optimise the operating system for example
  by piecing together disjointed files, removing superfluous files or compress
  big space demanding objects.

Do you need to install tools to keep the system running? Why (not)?
  They are not strictly needed for the operation of the system but they optimise
  the experience the user has. They increase efficiency or give the user more
  breathing room on his harddrive.
  Furthermore utility software mostly comes pre-installed with the operating
  system so the user is under no obligation to install this kind of software.
  Although if they want to they may install further programms.
